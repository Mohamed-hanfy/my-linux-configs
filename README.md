## my-linux-configs

This repository contains a collection of useful scripts that I use on my Linux system.  
They are here so I can easily reuse them, improve them over time, and share them with other people.

### What this repo is for

- **Personal utilities**: Small tools that automate or speed up common tasks.
- **Learning and experiments**: Trying out ideas, commands, and workflows.
- **Sharing**: Letting others see and reuse scripts that might help them too.
